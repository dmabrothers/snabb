Usage: run-nohw --help
       run-nohw --conf PATH --b4-if NAME --inet-if NAME [--verbose]

       --conf, -c PATH      Path to the lwAFTR configuration file.
       --b4-if, -B NAME     Name of the B4-side network interface.
       --inet-if, -I NAME   Name of the Internet-side network interface.
       --verbose, -v        Print CSV stats to stdout.
       --bench-file, -b FILENAME
                            The file or path name to which benchmark data is
                            written.  A simple filename or relative pathname
                            will be based on the current directory.
       --help, -h           Show this help message.

It runs the lwAFTR over two OS network interfaces.  The simplest way to run
it is to create 2 veth pairs and use them as the inet and b4 interfaces.
Flush traffic to the lwAFTR by pushing packets from the other end of the veth
pairs, using a program such as tcpreplay, for example.

When the -v option is used, packets on the network interfaces are counted
and recorded, and the corresponding incoming and outgoing packet rates are
written to stdout, in a format suitable for passing to a graphing program.
If bench-file is set, output is written to a file instead of stdout.
