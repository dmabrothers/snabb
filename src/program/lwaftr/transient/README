  -b BITRATE, --bitrate BITRATE
                             Peak at BITRATE bits/second.
  -s STEP, --step STEP
                             Increase bitrate in increments of STEP bits/second.
  -D DURATION, --duration DURATION
                             Linger on each step for DURATION seconds.
  -p period, --period PERIOD
                             Measure each PERIOD seconds.
  --bench-file FILENAME
                             The file or path name to which benchmark data is
                             written. A simple filename or relative pathname
                             will be based on the current directory. Default
                             is "bench.csv".
  -h, --help
                             Print usage information.

Transmit packets from the PCAP-FILE packet captures to the corresponding
PCI network adaptors.  Start at zero bits per second, ramping up to
BITRATE bits per second in increments of STEP bits per second, lingering
at each step for DURATION seconds.  The default is to ramp to 10 Gbps in
increments of 1 Gbps, lingering for 5 seconds at each step.  Once the
peak bitrate is reached, back down the same way until 0 is reached, and
end the test.

Packets received on the network interfaces are counted and recorded, and the
corresponding incoming and outgoing packet rates are written to a file in CSV
format, suitable for passing to a graphing program. The NAME values are used
to label the columns. Measurements will be taken each PERIOD seconds, which
defaults to 1.

  transient cap1.pcap tx 01:00.0
  transient -D 1 -b 5e9 -s 0.2e9 cap1.pcap "Name 1" 01:00.0 cap2.pcap "Name 2" 01:00.1
